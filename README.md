A game of mastermind in which players can either guess a randomly generated code, or create their own code for the CPU to crack. 

You have 12 guesses to crack the code. The CPU is programmed to crack the code in less than 12 guesses using the same rules as the player (the program only ever uses the code you input to check for guesses).
